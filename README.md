TODOs top of my head

Stuff to figure out:
- Helicopter landing / takeoff
- Movement on stairs / slopes
- jets and other vehicles (catapault is just a script, that should be possible)
- multiplayer: was thinking about doing all the precise position crap local to each client (have a local vehicle on each client, just synchronise high level motion)

Stuff to implement:
- Transitions from helicopter landing/takeoff to storage + crew moving around
- Controlling the ship (manual / waypoints)
- sound / particle effects


TODO:
- improve detection whether player is on a ship / which ship
- control action only when on the ship
- refactor: CfgFunctions
- refactor: functions more generic / architecture restructure
- improve ship physics model
